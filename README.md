How install Semtech Basic Station LoRA packet forwarder on a Raspberry Pi with a Imst iC880A-SPI radio module and connect it to TTN v3

## I wrote this doc for upgrading a working installation on a Raspberry Pi of a Semtech udp packet forwarder to the new Basic Station protocol. If you need to install the hardware go to [the best howto](https://github.com/ttn-zh/ic880a-gateway/wiki) and complete hardware install, stop before software install, and back here.

1. Get the source code:
```
git clone https://github.com/lorabasics/basicstation.git
```
2. Compile it:
```
cd basicstation
make platform=rpi variant=std
```
2. Manually install it:
```
mkdir /opt
mkdir /opt/basicstation
mkdir /opt/basicstation/bin
cp build-rpi-std/bin/station /opt/basicstation/bin
```
3. Create config directory:
```
mkdir /etc/basicstation
```
4. Create the service file:
```
/lib/systemd/system/basicstation.service
```
with this content
```
[Unit]
Description=Basic Sation TTN V3 service

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/opt/basicstation/bin
ExecStart=/opt/basicstation/bin/station -h /etc/basicstation
SyslogIdentifier=ttn-gateway
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

5. Go to TTN v3 console.
6. Create a new gateway checking the Require authenticated connection box.


## Choose which type of config you want LNS or CUPS, with CUPS you can control the gateway config from remote and in future you could do more thing, LNS configure only the router, this is what I understand after fast documentation reading, for best understand read [this link](https://doc.sm.tc/station/tcproto.html).

## LNS configuration


1. Go on gateway API kw√¨eys and add a new key, call it LNS and check the

Grant individual rights box

link as Gateway to a Gateway Server for traffic exchange, i.e. write uplink and read downlink box

Save changes

write down the key in a text file and save it for next usage, YOU CANNOT SEE THE KEY AFTER!!! If you loose it you must delete ad recreate it!!!

2. Return to the raspberry terminal.
3.
